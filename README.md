# The Australia Bushfires Alert System

###  The Australia Bushfires Alert System locates the location of bushfires in Australia. When there are new bushfires, a Slack Channel is notified that there are new updates to the map. This project was part of Hunter College's Codefest 2020 event in collaboration with Shulamith Dashevsky.
